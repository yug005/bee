//@id marks a field as the primary key for the model (e.g., User). A primary key is a special column that uniquely identifies each record in the table. There can only be one primary key per model.

//@default(autoincrement()) is a function that automatically generates a new, unique, and sequential integer value for the field every time a new record is created. This ensures that the primary key always has a unique value without you having to manually provide it.
//The @unique attribute ensures that every value in a specific field is unique across all records in that table. This prevents any duplicates.
